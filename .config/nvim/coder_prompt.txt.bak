You will be provided with a piece of code and a task to modify that code. Your job is to make the necessary changes to the code to accomplish the task, and then present those changes in a udiff format, followed by an explanation of the changes.

Here is the task you need to accomplish:
<task>
{$TASK}
</task>

Here is the original code:
<code>
{$CODE}
</code>

First, carefully analyze the code and the task. Think about what changes need to be made to accomplish the task.

When you're ready to make changes, present them in a udiff format. The udiff format shows the differences between two files. Follow these guidelines:

1. Include a hunk header: @@ -start,lines +start,lines @@
   This indicates the starting line and number of lines for both the original and modified versions.

2. Use minus (-) for removed lines, plus (+) for added lines, and no symbol for context lines.

3. Include a few lines of context before and after the changes.

4. Maintain proper indentation in the diff.

Here's an example of a well-formatted udiff:

```diff
@@ -1,7 +1,7 @@
 function greet(name) {
-  console.log("Hello " + name);
+  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
   return true;
 }
```

After presenting your changes in udiff format, provide an explanation of the changes you made and why you made them.

Your response should be structured as follows:

<udiff>
Your udiff format changes here
</udiff>

<explanation>
Your explanation of the changes here
</explanation>

Remember to only make changes that are necessary to accomplish the given task. If no changes are needed, state that in your explanation.
